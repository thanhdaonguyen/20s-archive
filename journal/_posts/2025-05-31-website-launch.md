Finally launched my personal archive website! It's been a few weeks of evening coding sessions, but I'm really happy with how it turned out. The site brings together three things I wanted to organize better: my daily journal entries, technical blog posts, and a proper showcase for my research projects.

The technical stack is pretty clean - Jekyll for static site generation, hosted on GitHub Pages, with a modular SCSS architecture that makes it easy to maintain. I spent extra time on the accessibility features and mobile responsiveness since I often read and write on my phone.

What I'm most excited about is having a single place to document both the technical and personal sides of my work. The journal section will help me reflect on daily progress and challenges, while the blog can dive deep into specific technical topics I'm exploring.

The work portfolio section came together really nicely too. I can showcase projects with proper context - the problems they solve, the technical approaches, and the outcomes. Much better than just having code repositories sitting around without explanation.

Looking forward to filling this with content over the coming months. There's something satisfying about having a well-organized, fast-loading site that's entirely under my control.

Next up: writing that long-overdue post about attention mechanisms in transformers that's been sitting in my drafts for weeks.

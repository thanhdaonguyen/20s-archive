I would like to create concise functional requirements for the following application:

The app is called "Thanhdao's Archive" and is a personal website application where I can do several things like: 
- Goofy journaling 
- Serious technical or life experience posts 
- Showcase my works (kind of a CV)

My Requirements:

- The app should be a static web app that I can deploy using github.io
- The app should have 3 main tabs/windows
    - An online journal:
        + Here is where I can occasionally put my life updates, funny cute little things of life, random thought on things I encounter in everyday life, etc.
        + The content is expected to be rather short. Don't need advanced formatting like markdown. plain text is okay
        + I can put one or many photos for each post
        + Each post will have date time, new post appear upper than old post
        + If there are too many posts, it should be organize in pages. Maximum post per page is 10

    - A blog archive:
        + Here I can showcase more serious blog posts in which I share experiences in important matters like my research, technical articles, mindset, meaningful stories
        + The homepage of the blog archive should show a list of blog post links. Each link only contain a thumbnail image, the title of the post, and date time. I need to click the link which redirect to another page where the whole blog is presented.
        
    - A work archive:
        + Here I can showcase my projects related to my professional as a researcher
        + The organization should be similar to the blog archive
